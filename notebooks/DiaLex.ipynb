        "*The favored method to compute the performance of our models is that of analogy tasks. The benchmark files utilized were generated by forming combinations of each w1 and w2 words from each relation in every dialect CSV file. The benchmark file consists of analogies, where lines are 4-tuples of words, split into sections by “: SECTION NAME” lines. Gensim library was used to evaluate the models and the accuracy was reported for each section separately, including an aggregate summary at the end. The chosen methodology to solving analogies is the vector offset (3CossAdd), which falls under the pair-based methods for solving analogies. A proportional analogy holds between two word pairs: a:a* :: b:b* (a is to a* as b is to b*) For example, Tokyo is to Japan as Paris is to France. With the pair-based methods, given a:a* :: b:?, the task is to find b*.  As a means of truly capturing a model’s accuracy, the final aggregated report includes a top-1, top-5, and top-10 accuracy result for each section, in which the b* word is searched for in the model’s top-k most similar words. Furthermore, the accuracies are computed over dummy4unknown=true, which produce zero accuracies for 4-tuples with out-of-vocabulary words and dummy4unknown=false, in which tuples are skipped entirely and not used in the evaluation.*\n"
